									<h2>Introduction</h2>

								</header>
							</div>
							<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">
								<p>“All ah we is one”, a statement that has history behind it, a statement that has an initiative but is this statement factual do we really see ourselves as one in the Caribbean, I believe we are not one as we do not emanate a sense of unity. To fully understand this statement first we must ask what it means to be Caribbean or West Indian as others prefer to call us. For some this is related to the geographical location, those who hail from islands in the Caribbean Sea are West Indian which is true but when we take a look at a map we see islands of Barbados, Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos are not actually part of the Caribbean Sea but are still considered Caribbean Islands. With this fact geographical location is not the only factor that dictates us being Caribbean we all have our own form of speech, our own culture, our own history and most importantly the people associated with our island societies all of which separate us from the rest of the world. Looking at the history of the Caribbean we see that this region is comprised of many different races and ethnicities which is the result of the Europeans colonizing these islands and forcibly shipping Africans across the Trans- Atlantic but not only Africans came to these islands there were also those hailing from the continent of Asia such as the Chinese and Indian indentured servants who migrated and mixed with the population. We all come from a similar history of hardships. Over time with the large diversity in Ethnicities came an intolerance for each other that has become more prominent, it stems from the centuries of slavery by the Europeans.
									These intolerances were spawned from issues such as colorism, superiority complexes when it came to culture with this why I believe we should say “All ah is not one”. I say this because we have been pitted against each other from times of slavery and even after 400 years in darkness for us we still feel its effects.</p>

							<h2>Culture</h2>
							
						</header>
						<p>As the years past the Caribbean has been known for its societies all having their own diverse culture. Due to our ancestors being brought here as slaves from Africa and the indentured servants who arrived from the likes of China and India to these islands many years ago. As time passed the Caribbean societies began to grow with each having their own culture. One can use culture as a factor of unification as we do share some lifestyles, practices and values which has been passed down through generations for example carnival, an event with roots that dig deep into the history of the region. Originally being a European festival the Africans soon began to participate around the 1830’s and it is said that this first began in Trinidad and Tobago. The carnival festival became a way for West Indians to express their culture while at the same satirizing their masters. Although each group has pride in their culture this pride leads to a xenophobic attitude in which man of the people of all the islands have towards one another. This has led to a somewhat lack of acceptance for the other variations of culture from thinking them to be inferior to their own. This superiority complex may stem from influence of European captives during times of slavery. The likes of the Spanish and the English had an ethnocentric mentality believing their own practices were superior. This mentality could have been adopted by later generations. Although not only the Europeans but also the fact some islands such as Trinidad have a far more diverse population in terms of ethnicity ranging from Chinese to Indian to Blacks. With such a diverse populace they may think the notion they are superior is warranted. Such notions overtime has created a divide in the people of the Caribbean.</p>

							<h2>Colorism</h2>
							
						</header>
						<p>Colorism is defined as the discrimination against those with darker skin typically among those of the same ethnic group. This is one of the most pressing issues in the Caribbean for many years. It is a factor that really puts a damper on the phrase “All ah we is one”. The people of many of the islands prefer others who are of a lighter skin tone believing this is what is beautiful, those who are darker skinned even go as far as to take measures to make their skin lighter by “bleaching”. In Jamaica schools had a clear preference for lighter skinned individuals. When we look at the biography “Una Marson” by Lisa Tomlinson we get an idea of this colorism. In Una’s school life at Hampton she highlighted that she was often berated by teachers and the headmistress but not only her, also others that were dark skinned like her. We also learn that her sisters who had a lighter skin tone were treated better. Colorism became prominent during times of slavery, using Barbados as an example when the British came here bringing African slaves along with them there were times where the slave master would have sexual interactions with slaves giving birth to mixed children. These individuals were considered to be neither black nor white and were called derogatory names like red necks and eckey becky. They caused a shift in the hierarchy where now the whites were at the top and the blacks were at the bottom but these mixed individuals were in between not having the privileges of the white but neither being slaves like the blacks giving rise to the notion that lighter skinned person were higher up the social ladder. Even after coming a long way from slavery “The slave trade has altered many norms of ethnic groups who have been exposed to it” (Valle) Beckles a claim he supports by saying “The effects of slavery and colonialism are like a miasm all around choking us.” (Beckles). An article in the Trinidad & Tobago Guardian title “Study: Race problems subtle in the Caribbean,” the IACHR commissioner and rapporteur on People of African Descent and Against Racial Discrimination Professor Rose Marie Belle Antoine stated that studies in Barbados showed black entrepreneurs find it much more difficult to secure business loans and capital than those of white descent. It is clear that we here in the West Indies still have not fully gotten past the 400 years of enslavement, we are still against one another.</p>

							<h2>Ethnicity and Race</h2>
							
						</header>
						<p>Ethnicity is defined as the state of belonging to a social group that has a common national or cultural tradition. There are many different ethnic groups scattered throughout the Caribbean. Indians, Chinese, Hispanics, those of African descent and those of European descent each having their own cultural identity. Such diversity in the Ethnicity stems from the migration of people from the different Continents including Asia, Europe and the Americas. Europeans began colonizing the lands in the Caribbean starting from the 15th century with the British enslaving and shipping Africans between the years of 1602 and 1807. The Chinese and Indians arrived in the Caribbean as indentured servants in the 19th century. Many of them were looking to escape the poor conditions in their homeland and being enticed by seemingly worthless contracts that trapped into years of hard labor with little benefit. Although each of them hail from different land hardships they faced during these times does give them of a sense of unity but the differences in culture and religion does create a divide within the society. Each group has different interest and will take every avenue that will guarantee security for those interest. Ethnicity can be a factor that brings unity as those of the same ethnic group usually have a sense of kinship but this mentality leads to prejudice against the other ethnic groups. In Barbados prejudice against Guyanese is common among the people, in an article titled “Are Guyanese Welcomed In Barbados” posted on the BBC Caribbean on highlighted this issue an anonymous Guyanese was quoted “There is discrimination against Guyanese of all ethnic groups but this anti-Indian feeling seems be more pronounced and prominent,”. Many Barbadians believe that too many Guyanese are coming into the country claiming they were here to take away our jobs.</p>

							<h2>Religion</h2>
							
						</header>
						<p>Religion is a social cultural system of appointed behaviors and practices, morals, ethics that connects humanity to supernatural and or spiritual forces. The West Indies is predominately a Christian society. However, there are many different denominations scattered throughout the islands from religion developed by the indentured servants and slaves on the islands to those brought by the Europeans during the 16th century. When the Spanish came to the to the Caribbean during the colonial era and settled in Jamaica they bought the Roman Catholic Church with them being the first denomination of Christianity to be established. If the Caribbean consist of mostly Christian why does the statement “All ah we is one” not apply? This domination of Christianity is precisely the problem, this religion was used in slavery to control masses of the slaves and drown out the culture and traditions they were hanging onto. Today we see the damage that this has done to our society causing a divide the between the separate religions. Those that have survived through slavery such as voodooism and those that developed overtime for example Rastafarianism which are both seen as inferior religions to Christianity. Voodooism is a religion cult in Haiti that originated from West Africa, it consisted of ancient practices of ancestor worship believing that spirits inhabited all forms of matter. Over time the voodoo has been demonized and perverted by those of the Christian faith as it does not follow the same practices and ethics they have, many now do not even know what voodoo stands far. Rastafarianism is another religion that is oppressed by the superiority of Christianity. Rastafarianism is an Afro Caribbean religion that originated in Jamaica during the 1930’s and has been adopted by many groups worldwide. One of the main symbolic features of rastafarians are their hairstyle sporting dreadlocks meant to symbolize the lion of Judah. In many of the Caribbean islands our schools have policies that prohibit the dreadlock hairstyle giving the option to cut their hair or cover it. Rastafarians in St. Kitts and Nevis complained that they faced harassment from the police and experience the mandatory cutting of dreadlocks when in prison and others reported they found it hard to get employment. How is this a sign of unity between people of different religions, instead of spreading a message of love they create tension between one another with prejudice and discrimination. We have just being fighting with one another about follows the right religion, whose God is the true God and whose scriptures speak the truth. We will never be one with these types of mentalities.</p>
